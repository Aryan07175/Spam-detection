# Spam-detection
This project is a machine learning-powered web application that detects whether an email is spam or not. It compares the performance of five popular ML models, ultimately selecting Naive Bayes as the most accurate. A Flask-based web app lets users input email text and get real-time predictions.

🚀 Features
Implemented and evaluated five classification models:
✅ Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Measured and compared model accuracy
Saved the best model (Naive Bayes) as model.pkl
Built an interactive Flask web interface for live spam prediction
📊 Model Accuracy Comparison
Model	Accuracy
✅ Naive Bayes	97.14%
Logistic Regression	96.67%
SVM	96.19%
Random Forest	94.76%
K-Nearest Neighbors	77.62%
➡️ Based on this evaluation, Naive Bayes was chosen as the final model.
